This is valid. Const strings are being constructed in a standard manner.

This is invalid. It seems to be unable to concatenate two const chars 
(both "Hello" and ", world").

This is valid. You can redeclare a variable with the same name, so long as 
they're in different scopes, like this example.

That's interesting. This works too. Seems nested scopes also allow for 
repeated variable names...

This doesn't compile...
New-lining all scoping braces, and tabbing reveals structure a bit better.
Re-jigging the scope solves the problem.

Thought it would display both names, them prompt for another entry.
Seems it treats the initial two names as two different inputs, showing
one, and then the next.
