Not valid as main appears to require the curly braces.

This is actually valid! Though it doesn't return. Odd.
Seems it needs those curley braces though.

This won't work because you can't nest block comments.

This will work, because anything after the // is ignored.

"int main{}" it seems!

Seems you can't put returns everywhere!
But you can if you add the "\" sign to follow onto the 
next line. This doesn't work with #includes though.
